Want to create a database of .tdb files with
1. Unaries e.g. Li.tdb, Al.tdb.
2. Binaries containing only binary compounds e.g. Li-Mg.tdb and Li-Sn.tdb
3. Ternaries containing only ternary compounds e.g. Li-Mg-Sn.tdb

These can then be merged by thermocalc when studying multicomponent systems.

Can have a script .sh to build a master database concatenating all of them.
